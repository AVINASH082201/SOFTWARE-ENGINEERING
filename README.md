# AUTOMATING ELECTIVE PROCESSING
# ABSTRACT
A dedicated website which has the features of open electives course allocation with specific requirements to the allocation admin and preference submission to students. At present the existing system is unmanageable which involves a heavy manual procedure which is submitting hard copies to the representative and manual allocation of courses by the allocation admin. It consists of course and student controllers to work on the website which takes data and allocates open electives to the students automatically according to their preferences. To integrate these processes onto the web by building a website , we are a proposing a website, which accomplishes the aforementioned tasks simply through mouse clicks. We would like to build a common platform which integrates both the tasks of course request and course allocation performed by students and course allocation respectively.
